end goal: recommender
My idea is to prompt the user to select some shirts they like, then
recommend similar shirts based off of embeddings created by a CNN.
So far I am just creating embeddings for all the shirts and printing
them out onto a html using a Python and Flask. I haven't tested the
accuracy of the embeddings yet.


1. Read in shirt data
"resize_rename_images" reads the 23 shirt images under /static/raw_shirts
it resizes them all to 244x244 and renames them

2. Get the embeddings
I made a tensorflow CNN. In the "predict_embeddings"
function, I create each embedding using the models
predict function (model.predict)
